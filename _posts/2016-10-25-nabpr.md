#The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion | NABPR

The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion [NABPR](https://nabpr.org) is a community of teaching scholars. Most members teach at Baptist-affiliated schools, colleges, and seminaries, but members also hail from a wide range of institutions in the United States, Canada, and abroad, including church-related and state-supported schools.


## Social Media manager
Recently I was hired to be the social media manager for NABPR and in this capacity I manage the website, two facebook groups, facebook page, twitter, and other social media platforms. Presently we use social media to reach out to members, live tweet conference keynotes and more. Until recently the website was hosted as a google site, until I moved it over to wordpress to better facilitate updating and maintaining the site while giving it a more modern look. Plus Wordpress allows for easier integration of online payments via paypal and better conforms to google and other search engines best practices.
