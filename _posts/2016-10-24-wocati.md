## The World Conference of Associations of Theological Institutions (WOCATI)

I have been part of WOCATI since 2008, when Prof. Dr. Namsoon Kang asked me to serve as the Web Administrator for the organization.
In this capacity I have been part of several major projects for WOCATI.

* Including the WOCATI Executive Committee Meeting held on March 17-20, 2009 held at Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.
* Several revisions of the website and shifts in hosts and platforms  
* Type-setting, copy editing, layout, and design of the WOCATI book [_Challenges and Promises of Quality Assurance in Theological Education_](https:///wocati.org/work/challenges-promises-quality-assurance-theological-education/).

## WOCATI website evolution
WOCATI started out as raw HTML and iFrames before moving onto typo3 hosted by the [World Council of Churches](https:///oikoumene.org) before moving onto Wordpress with a custom theme from themeforrest.net. Presently WOCATI's website is running on wordpress with the academica education theme by WP ZOOM. This iteration of the site uses a content delivery network backed by Amazon Cloudfront and Amazon S3 in order to quickly serve up the site and its many publications.
