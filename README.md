I am using the awesome Swiss Jekyll Theme by [@broccolini](https://broccolini.net/)  

## [Swiss Jekyll Theme](https://broccolini.net/swiss/)

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-swiss.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-swiss)

Swiss is a bold Jekyll theme inspired by Swiss design and the works of Massimo Vignelli. This theme lends itself well to sites heavy on written content.

### Features:
* Mobile-first design ensures this theme performs fastest on mobile while scaling elegantly to desktop-size screens.
* Designed for blogs and sites heavy on written content, with bold typography styles, homepage summaries, and previous/next snippets.
* Supports a wide range of HTML elements and markdown.
* Flexible styles that can be reused for customization without adding additional CSS.
* Dynamically generated navigation links. See docs for adding pages with specific post category for-loops.

### Installation
The Swiss Jekyll Theme is quite easy to use and install. If you wish to use the theme yourself visit the [Swiss Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) repo and for the respository.
