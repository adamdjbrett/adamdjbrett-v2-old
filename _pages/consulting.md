What is your story? As a Ph.D. candidate in religion, I understand the power and importance of telling stories and I want to help you find and tell your story. With over a decade of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) experience, I am well equipped to help you tell your story, whether that is through course development, pedagogy, websites, digital humanities, project, event planning, social media, or all of the above, I would be happy to help.

## Online Course Development and Pedagogy
I am available for consulting on course design, assignments, managing an online course, and integrating various online platforms into the classroom in meaningful ways that enhance the learning goals and outcome of the course.

### Learning Management Systems
Working in technology and communications I have extensive experience with Blackboard and Moodle on the backend and front-end of these platforms so I understand their limitations and the places where they excel
  - Blackboard
  - Moodle
  
### New Media in the Classroom
Are you interested in integrating new media into the classroom? I can help you navigate the wide array to platforms and find what meets your needs and your students needs. Whether that is one of the plaforms listed below or something else I'm here to help.
  - Blogging
  - Slack, Discord
  - Social Media
  - Podcasting
  - Online Video   

## Web Development
Are you interested in a website for your digital humanities project, an educational website, a professional site or even a personal site? I am here to help. My [CV](/cv/) contains an extensive list of projects and websites I have helped develop. I am committed to helping your find something that works well for your needs and fits within your budget. In today's media landscape it is critical for academic's and professionals of all types to have [A Domain of One's Own](https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/07/a-domain-of-ones-own/). I can help you ensure that your website is has *responsive web design* (HTML5/CSS/JS) and looks great on any device and loads quickly.
  - Single page websites
  - Blogs
  - complicated websites
  - Ecommerce
  - Static sites ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/))
  - Dynamic sites ([Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/))

## Events
Are you hosting a conference, symposium, academic, fundraiser, or an athletic event? I have helped to plan all of those and I'm available for event planning and consulting.

## Social Media
Social media is a vast landscape filled with every changing platforms. Not every platform works for every person or project. I would like to work with you to craft intentional social media content that reflects who you are and plays to the strengths of the social media platform that you wish to use.

## Past clients
For a list of some past clients and projects please take a look at my [CV](/cv/) and [posters and flyers](/posters-flyers/) that I have done.
